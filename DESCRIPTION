Authors@R: 
    person(given = "Peng",
           family = "Liu",
           role = c("aut", "cre"),

Description: This package is to identify the treatment benefiting and non-benefiting subgroups based on baseline characteristics. It searches for subgorup membership scores by maximizing a RMST or win-ratio based value function that directly reflects the subgroup-treatment interaction effect via gradient tree boosting.
